------------------------
1.7.0

* This version dropped support for Unity 4.1.4. Now UniWebView starts from 4.2.2. And 1.7.x will be the last versions support Unity version below 4.4 (because there is a compile error in iOS 8 SDK in the exported Xcode project, which is annoying and makes the development harder).

Migrate Guide - If you are using UniWebViewHelper.RunningOnRetinaIOS() to decide the insets of UniWebView, you may want to look at the Migrate Guide:

Due to introduction of iPhone 6 Plus and its new @3x scale, the old way would not work well. Now, all screen-size-based insets calculation for UniWebView should NOT use RunningOnRetinaIOS anymore. Instead you should use UniWebViewHelper.screenHeight and UniWebViewHelper.screenWidth and specify the point directly. For example, if you want to show a webview taking the upper half of screen, before version 1.7.0, it might be something like this:

    int uiFactor = UniWebViewHelper.RunningOnRetinaIOS() ? 2 : 1;
    int bottomInset = Screen.height / ( 2 * uiFactor );
    _webView.insets = new UniWebViewEdgeInsets(0,0,bottomInset,0);

Right now, with the new API, you can just use this:

    int bottomInset = (int)(UniWebViewHelper.screenHeight * 0.5f);
    _webView.insets = new UniWebViewEdgeInsets(0,0,bottomInset,0);

No more ui factor and device-specified calculation needed.

To make sure you can notice this change, the usage of RunningOnRetinaIOS() will cause an error now. You can just delete all usage of that, and change your insets code like the example above.
